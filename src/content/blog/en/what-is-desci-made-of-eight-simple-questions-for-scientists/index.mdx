You might have heard about DeSci in your life, or maybe not. Perhaps you've read that it's useful and beneficial and helps avoid barriers to publishing your research proposal and getting funding. But then you try to delve into it and... how the heck does it work? Where to go and what to do? You wonder: I'm a scientist, but I'm not a nerd. I don't speak IT. How can I understand anything there? Lost in that strange world of web3, you decide to submit your proposal to traditional scientific journals.

Yes, the DeSci community environment might feel a bit confusing for most scientists right now. But we're confident you can benefit from it. Let us explain why and how.

### What is DeSci?

**DeSci is a movement in science that aims to solve its current problems. DeSci means:**

- Easy access and contribution to scientific research
- Peer review of research proposals
- Research funding through crowdfunding and other transparent and equitable mechanisms
- Simple publication of results, regardless of how biased or controversial they might be
- Gaining recognition and building reputation
- Collaboration across the field

DeSci creates an environment of decentralized organizations. These organizations have no government center where decisions are made and information is stored. Their leadership is distributed among all community members. In the DeSci environment, the entire process of conducting and exchanging research becomes easier and faster, without compromising its security and depth. This happens thanks to the new technologies that are at the base of DeSci.

### Is DeSci a Science on the Blockchain, and How Does it Work?

Yes, DeSci uses blockchain technologies, but in a unique way.

First, let's recall what a blockchain is. The blockchain is a chain of information records organized in a distributed ledger. "Distributed" means that information is not stored in a single center but is hosted on millions of computers in the chain. It updates every ten minutes, continuously verifying all transactions, commitments, and new records made by its users. Therefore, blockchain is a secure and transparent system: no one has enough power to hack it, and every member can see all changes in the ledger.

Initially, blockchain was used for transactions, thus forming DeFi, which means decentralized finance. DeFi is about cryptocurrency-based financial services that have already proven their security, transparency, and convenience. It turns out that people can deal with money without banks and their complicated procedures. Now it's time for decentralized science, which uses these qualities of transparency and distribution to make funding, conducting, and publishing research faster, easier, and more accessible.

### What is an NFT and How Does it Help a Scientist?

There are several mechanisms through which DeSci can use blockchain to achieve its goals.

The most well-known is the NFT, which is already known in the art world. NFT (non-fungible token) is a cryptography certificate of any digital object. An NFT cannot be copied or substituted, but it can be sold. NFTs can be used to confirm ownership or use of a video game, an art object, or a university diploma. For example, in 2022, HOSEO University and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology gave their graduates NFT diplomas created on the OpenSea platform using Ethereum.

NFTs can also be used for scientific results. Some scientists are already creating their own NFTs to fund their proposals.

IP-NFTs represent legal rights to the intellectual property of research and data; they distribute ownership, authorship, and governance; they provide new ways to interact with trade secrets and publicity rights. For example, an engineer did a lot of work for medical research and contributed to its success, but researchers didn't mention him as an author: well, he is an engineer, and his contribution is considered "purely technical." But it's not fair, and IP NFT solves this problem: his work and authorship are recorded, and no one can deprive him of his intellectual property.

### What is a DAO and How Does it Work?

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization where the decision-making process is divided among community members. All procedures are encrypted in smart contracts that execute automatically.

Imagine an open scientific community of individual token holders who can share their research proposals, review others' research, vote for them, fund them with their tokens, and collaborate in any possible way. You get information and data without payment barriers. The DAO system encourages like-minded scientists worldwide to collaborate and work together.

### How Can My Research Be Funded?

There are several possible funding mechanisms proposed by DeSci.

**Crowdfunding**

Community members can donate money to fund research or participate in some way (for example, by providing necessary data or equipment).

**Sponsorship Through IP NFT Purchase**

An investor can buy the entire NFT project, or several investors can join together and buy it together, thus participating in intellectual property.

**Direct Voting**

Community members in DAO vote with their tokens. Voting tokens are like shares in a digital world: owning a token gives you the right to vote for research you like. A decentralized community of experts evaluates the research's value.

Imagine, for example, that you upload your research and get 100 tokens to vote for other community members' research. If the research gets a majority and is approved, the scientist can redeem the tokens they received for TIP3 tokens and get their real money to buy equipment and everything they need for their research. Voting for research gives you the opportunity to have a share of intellectual property and thus earn money, for example, if it's a pharmaceutical clinical trial or another important result that can generate business benefits. After its successful launch, the DAO can recover some of its money due to smart contract conditions.

### How Do Reputation Mechanisms Work in DeSci?

Reputation in DeSci doesn't depend on your ability to publish your proposals in scientific journals. It's more about your real contribution and how other community members estimate it. Every DAO member participates and makes commitments toward their goal. All decisions are transparent and contribute to participants' reputation. This can happen in various ways, which can manage reputations across the community and throughout the DeSci world.

GOSH DAO, for example, proposes CFTs (committed fungible tokens), which work like an h-index or digital CV. In the DeSci environment, you don't need to multiply your publications to access funding. You can simply conduct your research and get CFTs from other community members who appreciate your results.

As a community member, you also have your CFTs and can grant them to others when you appreciate their commitment. Your CFT also grows when you review others' proposals, participate in mentoring, collaborate on other authors' research, and perform any other activity related to your area. With CFTs, you don't need to worry about presenting your qualities to the world. CFTs completely automate this process.

### What Real Things Have Already Been Done In and Through the DeSci Community?

Since 2021, there has been explosive growth in DAO initiatives. There has been great progress in data sharing, fundraising, and peer review.

The pioneer here is biotech DAOs, like VitaDAO, which funds early-stage research for longevity, human life extension, and healthy life expectancy. They have already funded more than 10 research projects related to Alzheimer's disease, aging, and other topics. You can buy Vita tokens or earn them through collaboration. VitaDAO has more than 1300 token holders at this moment. Last week, VitaDAO closed a $4.1 million funding round with Pfizer Ventures and other investors.

The Molecule DAO aims to bring together researchers and potential investors, with more than 4500 DAO community members and 3 Bio DAOs with over $10 million in their network dedicated to research. It's a great hub of DAOs looking for funding and investors who need innovative startups.

But most DAOs are still in their infancy, which doesn't make them less interesting. For example, LabDAO focuses on sharing equipment and IT tools and helping bio scientists and engineers collaborate, share data, and save funds on resources and equipment.

### What Does DeSci Still Need to Do?

DeSci is just beginning to collaborate with traditional forms of the current scientific system and government regulators. They need more bridges to work together, especially in fields like public health or preventing global warming. There are unresolved questions about the role of experts in DAOs because it's not an easy task to combine transparency and fairness with competent research evaluation. Also, there's an issue: sometimes, Web3 enthusiasts focus too much on their tools rather than on their integration into scientists' work. These two worlds should meet.

But these problems are manageable. The faster scientists, doctors, and the general public discover DeSci's advantages, the more diverse, popular, and prosperous the DeSci world will be and the more it will contribute to public good. Maybe it's a bit confusing for now, but we're sure it can bring a lot to your research and is worth exploring.
