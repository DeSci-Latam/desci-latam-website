Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are new and trendy. If you’re considering joining a DAO, it’s rational to evaluate it first. The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether it’s worthwhile and promising to join such an organization. This isn’t about complex assessment mechanisms but simple and ready ways to distinguish between something useless or potentially risky and a valuable tool or beneficial environment for you.

## WHAT?: mission, objectives, and product

A DAO is a community that exists for a specific purpose, whether commercial or not. Therefore, it should have well-defined strategic goals and, ideally, a mission. Its participants contribute to this mission through their proposals, which the community evaluates for implementation and funding, among other things.

### Good Example

Bloomeria DAO helps communities protect green areas. It has a clear mission displayed right on the homepage of its website: "to help fund reforestation and conservation projects, connect environmental organizations with companies willing to fund meaningful initiatives; and assist companies in demonstrating their ESG commitments through blockchain technology." This shows that these individuals know what they are proposing to the world.

### Unclear Example

FrontierDAO states its mission is "to build a thriving community that embraces a vibrant future in this world and beyond. We’re doing this by pursuing bold new ideas through cooperative research and innovation in science, space, fusion energy, and Web3." While impressive, this mission is not clear enough.

## HOW MUCH?: size, age, number of proposals, and successful projects

There are no metrics that can definitively tell you whether a DAO is good or not, although many are available. This is because different DAOs are at different stages of their evolution. Some are promising but have only just begun operating. Additionally, the growth period can vary significantly depending on the goals and missions. If a DAO’s mission is concrete and niche (e.g., providing grants to people creating wildlife documentary videos) or its objectives are partly commercial (like DAOs dealing with pharmaceutical clinical trials), it will likely show its first successes sooner than one focused purely on public goods (like rainforest conservation or ocean cleanup).

However, we can analyze some metrics and draw conclusions. We can look at:

- **Longevity**: How long has a DAO existed? A DAO that has been around for several years tends to be more sustainable than a new one. It’s common for projects (whether DAOs or traditional centralized organizations) to have an initial hidden development period after which they may suddenly succeed. "Old" DAOs are more likely to have overcome that growth period.

- **Financial metrics**: These include treasury size, revenue streams, monthly expenses, and transparent accounting that can be observed thanks to blockchain.

- **Voting procedures and number of proposals**: These might take place on Discord or Telegram, but it’s better if a DAO has safer, more transparent on-chain voting procedures.

## HOW?: technology, regulation, governance

It’s not always easy to determine if the project you plan to join is truly a DAO. Is it really autonomous? Decentralized? And importantly, is it an organization or just a Discord chat?

- **Level of decentralization**: Decentralization means a DAO relies on a decentralized blockchain protocol.

- **Regulation and governance**: An organization can be viewed as a collection of relationships and agreements. Smart contracts predefine the rules that will automatically execute in a DAO for the community with those relationships and agreements.

- **Cybersecurity**: Blockchain ensures the organization’s regulation is carried out as defined by the smart contracts.

## WHO?: community and partners

Every DAO is primarily a community, so we can evaluate its number of members.

A new but rapidly growing community indicates increasing interest in the DAO, as does the number of Twitter followers and other social media members.

## WTF?: clarity and ease of use

Last but not least, a DAO should have clear and understandable procedures for creating proposals and executing all transactions.

We wish you the best of luck in choosing a safe, solid, clear, agile, and evolving DAO with a strong brand that perfectly meets your needs and inspires you to participate and achieve your goals!
