## Introduction

Basic science is the foundation upon which technological progress and the socioeconomic development of nations are built. In Latin America, a region with enormous potential but also significant challenges, investing in basic science represents a crucial opportunity to boost growth and address both local and global problems.

Latin America has a unique context: a region rich in natural resources and cultural diversity but historically faced with obstacles to scientific and technological development. Despite having renowned academic institutions and talented scientists, the region continues to struggle to match the levels of research and development (R&D) investment seen in more advanced economies.

## Understanding Science

### What is basic science? üß¨

Basic science, also known as fundamental research, is the study of the fundamental principles of nature and the universe. Its primary goal is to expand human knowledge without an immediate practical application in mind. It is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, driven by curiosity and the desire to understand how the world works.

### What is applied science? üõ†Ô∏è

Applied science focuses on using existing scientific knowledge to develop practical solutions to specific problems. It seeks to apply the principles discovered through basic science to create new technologies, products, or processes that directly benefit society.

### Relationship between basic and applied science

Although distinct in their immediate goals, basic and applied science are intricately connected. Basic science provides the foundational knowledge upon which applied science builds its innovations. Without fundamental research, many of the technological advances we take for granted today would not exist.

## The Impact of Basic Science üöÄ

### Global Examples

- [Electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations) and its impact on electricity and communications
- [mRNA vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA) and their role in combating COVID-19
- [The theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) and its application in [GPS systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System)
- [Particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) and its contribution to [diagnostic imaging medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography)
- [Transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) and [integrated circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit): Quantum theory was crucial for the development of these components, which are the foundation of modern electronics.
- [Genomic medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project): The Human Genome Project has enabled significant advances in personalized medicine and more precise diagnostics.
- [Battery technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery): Research in chemistry and materials physics has been key to developing more efficient batteries, essential for vehicle electrification and renewable energy storage.

### Examples from Latin America

- [The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming): This antibiotic, which saved millions of lives worldwide, was a result of basic research in microbiology.
- [The development of the hepatitis B vaccine by Baruch Blumberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Samuel_Blumberg): This Mexican scientist received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery, which has prevented millions of cases of liver disease in Latin America and globally.
- [Development of agricultural biotechnology in Argentina](https://www.magyp.gob.ar/sitio/areas/biotecnologia/conabia/_pdf/Cultivos_GM.pdf): Argentina has been a pioneer in developing genetically modified crops, such as transgenic soybeans, increasing agricultural productivity and contributing to regional food security.
- Research on biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon
- Advances in renewable energy in Chile and Mexico
- Contributions to astronomy from observatories in Chile

### Long-Term Impact

Basic science has a profound and lasting impact on society, although this often materializes decades after the initial discoveries. It drives innovation, improves quality of life, and provides solutions to global challenges such as climate change and emerging diseases.

### Latin America‚Äôs Landscape

R&D investment in Latin America remains significantly lower than in developed economies. Brazil leads the region with 1.3% of GDP, followed by Argentina and Mexico. However, most Latin American countries invest less than 0.5% of their GDP in R&D, which limits their capacity for innovation and scientific development.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) publications have a slightly greater impact on GDP compared to total publications. This highlights the importance of fostering research in these areas for the economic development of the region.

## Current Challenges for Basic Science in Latin America ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Insufficient Funding
R&D investment in most Latin American countries is far below the global average, limiting the ability to conduct cutting-edge research.

### Brain Drain
Many talented researchers leave the region in search of better opportunities and resources in other countries, leading to a significant loss of human capital.

### Limited Infrastructure
Many institutions lack the equipment and facilities needed to conduct high-level research, hindering global competitiveness.

### Low Academia-Industry Collaboration
Compared to more developed regions, there is less knowledge transfer between universities and the private sector, limiting the practical application of research.

### Political and Economic Instability
Frequent policy changes and budget cuts can disrupt long-term research projects and discourage investment in science.

### Language Barriers
The dominance of English in scientific literature can pose a challenge for some Latin American researchers, limiting their international visibility.

### Unequal Resource Distribution
Within the region, some countries and institutions have significantly more resources than others, potentially limiting regional collaboration and equitable scientific development.

## New Opportunities: Decentralized Science (DeSci) üåê

### Grants üèÜ
DeSci is introducing new ways of funding through decentralized grants, enabling innovative projects to receive support directly from the global community.

### DAOs üèõÔ∏è
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging as a new way to organize and govern scientific projects, promoting transparency and community participation in decision-making.

### NFT and IP-NFT üñºÔ∏è
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Intellectual Property NFTs (IP-NFTs) are creating new ways to recognize and monetize scientific achievements, potentially revolutionizing how knowledge is valued and shared.

### Decentralized Financing üí°
Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are opening new avenues for funding research, enabling microinvestments and global participation in scientific projects.

## Conclusion: The Future of Basic Science in Latin America üöÄ

### Reflections for the Future
Basic science is fundamental to the sustainable development of Latin America. Despite the challenges, the region has enormous potential to become a hub of scientific innovation. Investing in basic science will not only drive economic development but also help address regional and global challenges.

### Call to Action
It is crucial for governments, academic institutions, the private sector, and civil society to work together to:

1. Increase investment in basic science
2. Improve research infrastructure
3. Foster international and regional collaboration
4. Create incentives to retain and attract scientific talent
5. Promote knowledge transfer between academia and industry
6. Explore and adopt new models of scientific funding and organization, such as DeSci

The future of Latin America depends significantly on its ability to nurture and harness the power of basic science. It‚Äôs time to plant the seeds of progress to harvest a prosperous and sustainable future.
