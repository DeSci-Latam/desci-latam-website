The world of Decentralized Science (DeSci) is new to most people in the scientific field. However, it may soon offer an attractive alternative to traditional scientific practices. While DeSci has the potential to combat censorship, make funding more accessible, and provide researchers with hope for equality and transparency, it still faces many challenges before it can transform the landscape.

## What is DeSci, and why is it so attractive?

In short, DeSci is Open Science on a blockchain. It uses Web3 tools to accelerate, facilitate, and make funding, conducting, and publishing research more accessible. Community-driven entities now exist in the form of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) that operate without centralized governance.

Community members make decisions on research proposals by voting with their tokens. The governance rules are encoded and executed automatically through smart contracts. Members are incentivized to vote for projects with the highest potential, thus reaping benefits in return.

Additionally, they share information and data without paywalls and review proposals in exchange for tokens, which can function as both reputation and incentive mechanisms. DAOs thus address key issues in research work: funding, early evaluation, data access, review, reputation-building, cybersecurity (via NFTs and other means), and publishing.

However, these efforts are not without some inevitable issues. DeSci is still in its infancy and has much to resolve before it can reshape the landscape. So, what are these challenges?

## 1: DeSci is not easy to access

Traditional science is often inequitable, and DeSci provides fairer mechanisms. But there’s another barrier: scientists are rarely familiar with IT, cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, tokens, NFTs, and similar technologies. These concepts are not easy to grasp, let alone utilize.

Currently, most of the enthusiasm for DeSci comes from people within the Web3 ecosystem. However, DeSci's core goal is to use Web3 tools to benefit scientists. This contradiction could hinder its adoption as a mass movement. By its very nature, DeSci works best when many people globally participate in it.

**Solution.** To engage scientists in DeSci, we need to build an infrastructure that is user-friendly. Communication efforts must also make Web3 tools accessible and practical. The situation could improve if tech ambassadors take steps toward researchers, such as providing simple guides and explaining how to use DeSci tools to both scientists and the general public.

## 2: DeSci does not collaborate enough with traditional scientific institutions

This issue partially stems from the first: DeSci does not currently align with academia but distances itself from it and criticizes it. Academia "does not believe" in DeSci or is unaware of its existence. A common language and shared values are needed for communication.

**Solution.** New forms of collaboration between the two worlds should emerge. Traditional institutions that struggle to fund their projects could use DAOs for that purpose. Simultaneously, university scientists can contribute their expertise to DAOs during the study evaluation process.

## 3: DeSci needs new management tools

There are many tools in the Web3 ecosystem that function differently and solve different problems. DAOs need to identify and practice effective voting procedures, governance, and decision-making processes.

The issue of intellectual property (IP) is also critical. Legal procedures must be developed to ensure IP security in complex situations. For instance, researchers often share IP ownership with their institutions, complicating full ownership. Agreements between universities and DAOs will be necessary. Additionally, major players (like corporations or industries) could acquire IP from smaller researchers, potentially affecting fairness.

**Solution.** DAOs must work on developing proper regulations to address these situations. It’s crucial to share experiences and test different blockchain technologies. New methods for transferring IP and ensuring security will also need to be implemented.

## 4: DeSci could face research quality issues

Token holders have equal decision-making power, with no requirements for education or the ability to distinguish good science from pseudoscience. Imagine a DAO where all members are homeopaths or conspiracy theorists.

**Solution.** DAOs should incorporate governance and reputation mechanisms to mitigate this risk. For example, proposals could undergo pre-screening by experts (verified scientists). These experts would assess proposal quality and eliminate inadequate ones. This could also be an area of potential collaboration with academia, which could supply qualified experts for the approval process.

## 5: DeSci might prioritize commercial research over fundamental science

Community members may choose to fund only research with commercial potential, neglecting studies pursuing fundamental scientific goals. This could lead to prioritizing marketable results over essential scientific exploration.

**Solution.** DAOs could allocate resources so that profits from commercial research fund fundamental research, or use data and results from fundamental research to conduct commercial studies. This way, DAOs could establish a full research collaboration cycle, from basic levels to practical implementation.

## 6: The DeSci world needs common values

Currently, DeSci enthusiasts champion values like transparency, equal access to research and data, and other positives. Some DAOs set specific missions to address concrete problems. However, traditional science serves diverse stakeholders — including scientific journals, academia, pharmaceutical industries, higher education, and governments. For DeSci, it remains unclear:

Who are DAOs serving? Are we building an alternative universe with its own economy, where every party benefits and public good is the priority? Will this model be more sustainable and equitable than the current one?

These questions shape the shared values of the entire DeSci community. Examples of potential issues include fraud and a lack of clarity in token economies, which undermine trust and discourage Web2 users from joining Web3 projects. Another concern is the underrepresentation of women in Web3, reflecting disparities in STEM and crypto communities. Can DAOs change this?

**Solution.** As the DeSci environment grows, we must define common values and clear boundaries. To promote equity, DAOs need well-thought-out procedures that consider diverse perspectives. Smart contracts and artificial intelligence might help identify optimal solutions, but goodwill is essential.

## 7: Sometimes, DeSci is too centralized

Decentralization can be challenging, especially for Web3 participants who lack the qualities needed for truly distributed leadership. For instance, a recent DAO advocating for the democratization of psychedelic substances (PsyDAO) blocked public discussions about conflicts of interest in its leadership. Such behavior harms the DAO's reputation.

"The 'D' and 'A' in DAO are often inaccurate; most of the time, a few actors end up controlling the project like any traditional company, with all associated risks," commented HealthXChange, a Web3 health-tech startup, about the case.

**Solution.** The key asset of non-hierarchical communities is clear procedures for horizontal communication. This includes decision-making rules and internal and external communication methods, with a tone aligned to core values and mission. Smart contracts alone are insufficient; soft skills are equally important.

## Conclusion

We love DeSci. This love will help us turn it into an adaptable universe capable of:

- Creating clear and simple ways to engage scientists and the general public.
- Developing a legal and regulatory framework for collaboration with traditional scientific institutions.
- Establishing effective procedures for governance and IP transfer.
- Avoiding the pitfalls of funding inappropriate research.
- Achieving a balance between commercialization and fundamental science.
- Building a sustainable system of shared values.
- Empowering true decentralization, which also means distributed leadership, transparency, and genuine democracy.

Let’s join forces and tackle these challenges together.
