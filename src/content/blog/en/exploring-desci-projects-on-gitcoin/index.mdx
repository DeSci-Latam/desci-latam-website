## Scientific Publishing

### The DeSci Journals - DeScier

The DeSci Journals project seeks to address issues in the scientific publishing industry by creating a decentralized platform for scientific journals. Currently, scientific authors receive no royalties from traditional publishers, despite the industry's substantial revenue, comparable to the music industry. DeSci Journals aims to change this by enabling communities to retain 100% of their copyrights, share profits, and monetize the work of highly skilled content creators.

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- High publication fees and access barriers.  
- Oligopolistic control generating $26 billion annually.  
- Lengthy peer-review and publication processes.

**Proposed Solution:**  
A decentralized publishing platform empowers scientists and academics to retain copyrights, share knowledge, and financially benefit from their work. The adoption of Arbitrum by the scientific community could enhance tangible use cases and amplify its impact.

**Use of Funds:**  
Funds will support smart contract development, audit processes, creation of NFTs for scientific documents, a secondary market for NFTs, automated online manuscript submission, and privacy-identification exploration. Additionally, the project will focus on author reputation systems within the decentralized framework.

## Health and Medicine

### Asterisk

Asterisk is a decentralized organization focused on addressing disparities in research for women's non-reproductive health worldwide. The initiative aims to develop data lakes for female-specific disorders, establish price discovery mechanisms, and create a DAO to fund research initiatives.

**Challenges Addressed:**  
Womenâ€™s non-reproductive health receives significantly less funding compared to reproductive health, highlighting an urgent need for equitable resource distribution.

**Use of Funds:**  
Funds will complete the AsteriskDAO whitepaper, establish a research repository, and validate a technology transfer model.
