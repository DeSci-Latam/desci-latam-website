As a scientist, you’ve likely encountered the buzzword “Open Science” and heard about its benefits. Open Science promises transparency, equity, rapid access to information, collaboration, and resources. Advocates claim it will make research faster, more effective, and accessible. But is this really the case? If not, why, and what can be done about it?

### Open Science is a Set of Practices

Open Science emerged decades ago as an antidote to the traditional scientific model, which struggled to meet modern challenges. The system was seen as slow and hierarchical. Scientists worldwide recognized the need for a more democratic environment and began building it using the internet.

The essence of Open Science is that you can make your research open by yourself. As a scientist, you aim to be transparent with other researchers in your community. Thus, you adopt various practical principles and share them with other Open Science enthusiasts. These people are driven by the desire to serve the public good, even if it doesn’t provide immediate benefits. This motivation stems from shared values and the belief that, in the long run, such behavior will bring more advantages.

Sounds promising, right? Let’s examine how these principles manifest in practice.

**Principle 1: Pre-registration**

**Expectation:**  
You publish your research plan before conducting your research. This plan might include research questions, hypotheses, detailed methodologies, initial experiments, and data descriptions. Doing this encourages other scientists in your field to critique your methods, goals, and problem formulation. This early feedback can help avoid mistakes and save time, money, and effort.

**Reality:**  
You make your research open, but it’s not enough. No one critiques your work because they don’t know it exists. Experts lack the motivation to contribute in their free time, and there are no reliable tools or spaces for collaboration.

**Principle 2: Open Data and Code**

**Expectation:**  
You make your data and code open whenever possible, enabling other scientists to verify your research's reproducibility. Essentially, you say: “Here are my data; conduct your analysis to see if you get the same results.”

**Reality:**  
Different data formats make accessibility difficult. Additionally, methodological differences prevent others from reproducing results, leading to systematic errors and confusion.

**Principle 3: Accessible Preprints**

**Expectation:**  
You publish a preprint in an open-access platform, ensuring everyone can see that you were the first to achieve a specific result. This also addresses replicability: “Here are my findings; apply them to your data and see if you get the same results.”

**Reality:**  
Your ideas might get stolen, or even worse, cited before your final publication. Consequently, the world sees your incomplete, imperfect results, and your h-index doesn’t grow because preprints aren’t considered. Moreover, preprints often struggle to transition into final articles.

**Principle 4: Accessible Resources**

**Expectation:**  
You make all resources—servers, software, educational materials, or other assets—available to the community. Crowdfunding may also be part of this process.

**Reality:**  
Paywalls and barriers for unaffiliated individuals persist. Once again, there’s little incentive for others to fund your research. Why should they?

**Principle 5: Outreach**

**Expectation:**  
You collaborate, communicate, and share information with other scientists, the general public, and media outlets. This broadens your research’s impact, adjusts your future goals based on feedback, and educates the public.

**Reality:**  
Media outlets struggle to distinguish between good science and pseudoscience. They often misunderstand preprints and exaggerate findings, leading to speculation and misinformation.

### The Problems with Open Science

The primary issue with Open Science is that it relies solely on goodwill and enthusiasm. This limits its effectiveness and prevents it from competing with the traditional scientific system. Despite its efforts, Open Science hasn’t replaced the traditional model over the decades. Instead, it exists in a parallel universe, contributing positively but insufficiently to improving the world of science.

Additionally, Open Science practices have inadvertently caused inflation in scientific publications, leading traditional journals to charge exorbitant fees—up to $11,000 per article in *Nature*.

Open Science has raised the need for democratization but lacks the power and means to fully achieve it. However, a new solution is emerging to bolster Open Science principles: Decentralized Science, or DeSci.

### What Does Web3 Bring to Open Science?

DeSci leverages Web3 tools to amplify Open Science principles, offering new incentives for participation and collaboration. Here are some key mechanisms:

**Blockchain Technology:**  
This allows project ownership to be distributed among community members, enabling the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). DAOs operate without central governance, using smart contracts to ensure fair resource distribution.

**Tokens:**  
Tokens incentivize peer review, crowdfunding, and other contributions. They can be exchanged for real money or used to build reputation within the scientific ecosystem.

**IP NFTs:**  
NFTs (non-fungible tokens) serve as cryptographic certificates for digital assets. In DeSci, they can confirm ownership or use of research outputs and serve other purposes.

### How DeSci Benefits Open Science Enthusiasts

Here’s how DeSci transforms Open Science principles into tangible benefits:

1. **Pre-registration:**  
Smart contracts reward you with tokens for publishing your research plan and encourage others to review it. This incentivizes early feedback and improves research quality.

2. **Open Data and Code:**  
Public blockchains and IP NFTs ensure your intellectual property remains secure yet accessible.

3. **Accessible Preprints:**  
DeSci removes conflicts of interest, fostering credibility and openness.

4. **Accessible Resources:**  
Funding mechanisms in DeSci reduce barriers and make resources more accessible.

5. **Outreach:**  
Collaboration and communication are easier and more transparent in a Web3 ecosystem. Media and investors are increasingly interested in DAOs, which offer pre-vetted ideas and evidence-based results.

### Conclusion

If you’re an Open Science enthusiast, DeSci offers an exciting new world of possibilities. Dive into this ecosystem and see how it can transform your research!
